# ObserverDesignPattern
LLD for Observer Design Pattern

This is often used when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects. The pattern ensures that all dependents ‘observe’ an object and are immediately notified if it changes its state. It’s a bit like when retailers inform subscribers about events that are of interest to them  (i.e. the release of a new product or a sale).
